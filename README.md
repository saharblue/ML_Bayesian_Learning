An implementation of a Bayesian Learning model. The goal is to classify a new instance according to its features values by maximizing the posterior probability, provided with various class options.
Attached are a Python file which contains the implementation, a data directory containing several CSV files as an example of datasets for training and testing purposes, and a jupyter notebook file for running tests and visual demonstration.
